# Password-Generator

In this repository, the objective was to generate a random password based on specific criteria selected by the user.
Following a series of prompts and confirms, the users password will be selected. 

The password criteria is ran inside of a function to generate the password. Within this function, variables are defined to each specific criteria the user selects.
Using the concat method, respective variables are assigned to an array in which the user selects for their specific criteria. With using a loop, the selected criteria will
then generate a random password for the user.
